Miscellaneous settings and tools for self use.


Quick Setup
-----------

`selfconfig` is available to setup the functions, scripts, and aliases in *self*. It must be run from within the `self` folder, in your bash_profile add:

	pushd ~/self > /dev/null
		source selfconfig
	popd > /dev/null


Miscelaneous
------------

Some of the scrips in *self* depend on the [gools][gools] project.
