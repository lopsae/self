iTerm settings
==============

In Preferences/General, enable "Load preferences from custom folder" and use
	/Users/mlopez/self/settings/iterm

The application will prompt to save the settings in the folder, choose "No". If you do so the current settings will override the saved ones.

Close the application and reopen.
