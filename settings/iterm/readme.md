iTerm settings
==============

In Preferences/General, enable "Load preferences from custom folder" and use
	/Users/mlopez/self/settings/iterm

The application will prompt to save the settings in the folder, choose "No". If you do so the current settings will override the saved ones.

Close the application and reopen.


Changes in the plist file
=========================

The iterm2.plist file usualy ends up with some minor changes after each time the iterm application is closed, as it saves information regarding the app state.

When settings are modified, make sure to close the iterm application. Only at that point settings are saved.
